Can you solve this real interview question? Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String - Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

 

Example 1:


Input: haystack = &quot;sadbutsad&quot;, needle = &quot;sad&quot;
Output: 0
Explanation: &quot;sad&quot; occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.


Example 2:


Input: haystack = &quot;leetcode&quot;, needle = &quot;leeto&quot;
Output: -1
Explanation: &quot;leeto&quot; did not occur in &quot;leetcode&quot;, so we return -1.
